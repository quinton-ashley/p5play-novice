If you're an independent developer, small dev team, or student that can't afford to comply with the p5play Professional License Agreement, you can apply for a p5play [p5play Novice License](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play-novice/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

Using the same email you used to sign up for a [p5play membership](https://p5play.org/pro/), send a message to info@p5play.org with the title "novice applicant". In the body of the email write a description of how you plan to use p5play commercially. If you're approved, you will be notified via a response to your email.
