This License Agreement ("Agreement") is made between Quinton Ashley, the sole copyright owner of p5play ("Licensor"), and a valid applicant whose commercial project is currently listed on the [p5play-novice](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play-novice) GitHub repository README.md page ("Licensee").

## 1. License Grant

This Agreement pertains to the p5play, q5, and p5play-pro software libraries ("Content") and proprietary supplemental materials ("Supplemental Materials"), such as app template source code, which are only provided for use by novice and professional Licensees.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-perpetual worldwide license.

The Licensee is authorized to utilize the Content and Supplemental Materials in closed-source commercial projects, subject to the following restrictions:

- No Closed Source Modifications: The Licensee is expressly forbidden from creating a closed source fork of the Content or using modified versions of the Content in closed source projects.

- No Redistribution of the Supplemental Materials: The Licensee is expressly forbidden from redistributing the Supplemental Materials in any way.

Licensees retain the option to use the p5play-pro library under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 and use the p5play and q5 libraries under the terms of the AGPLv3.

## 2. Licensee Eligibility

To qualify as a valid applicant, you must either have a household income of less than $30,000 USD or be a member of a low income household as defined by your local government.

By applying for the opportunity to comply with this license agreement, you affirm that you are a valid applicant. The Licensor may ask for proof of your eligibility. The Licensor reserves the right to deny any applicant for any reason, at any time.

To apply, email info@p5play.org with the title "novice". In the body of the email write a brief description of how you plan to use p5play commercially.

If you're approved, you'll be added to the [p5play-novice][] README.md.

This license exists to give novice developers the opportunity to use p5play commercially. If you can afford to be an active paying subscriber, at the appropriate tier, to the Licensorâ€™s [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/quinton-ashley) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/p5play) ("Licensee"), please consider doing so. If you financially benefit from using p5play, it's only fair that you support its development!

## 3. Attribution Required

The Licensee must publicly display appropriate credit to the Licensor for the Content, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the Licensee or the Licensee's use.

Attribution must be accomplished by maintaining the "made with p5play" Loading Screen, which is enabled by default. The Licensee may not remove the "made with p5play" Loading Screen without the express written permission of the Licensor.

## 4. No Warranty

The Content is provided "as is." The Licensor makes no warranties, express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, concerning the Content.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages suffered by the Licensee resulting from the use or inability to use the Content.

## 6. Termination

Termination of the Agreement will occur if the Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Therefore, termination can occur automatically, without notice from the Licensor.

If the Licensee's project is no longer publicly listed on the p5play-novice GitHub repository README.md page, this Agreement will be immediately terminated.

## 7. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement can be amended by the Licensor at any time. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
