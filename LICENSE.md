This Agreement pertains to the p5play, q5, and p5play-pro software libraries ("Content") and proprietary supplemental materials ("Supplemental Materials"), such as app template source code, which are only provided for use by novice and professional Licensees.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-perpetual worldwide license.

The Licensee is authorized to utilize the Content and Supplemental Materials in closed-source commercial projects, subject to the following restrictions:

- No Closed Source Modifications: The Licensee is expressly forbidden from creating a closed source fork of the Content or using modified versions of the Content in closed source projects.

- No Redistribution of the Supplemental Materials: The Licensee is expressly forbidden from redistributing the Supplemental Materials in any way.

Licensees retain the option to use the p5play-pro library under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 and use the p5play and q5 libraries under the terms of the AGPLv3.

## 2. Licensee Eligibility

To qualify as a valid applicant, you must either have a household income of less than $30,000 USD or be a member of a low income household as defined by your local government.

By applying for the opportunity to comply with this license agreement, you affirm that you are a valid applicant. The Licensor may ask for proof of your eligibility. The Licensor reserves the right to deny any applicant for any reason, at any time.

Using the same email you used to sign up for a [p5play membership](https://p5play.org/pro/), send a message to info@p5play.org with the title "novice applicant". In the body of the email write a description of how you plan to use p5play commercially. If you're approved, you will be notified via a response to your email. Only approved valid applicants may use p5play under the terms of this license.

This license exists to give novice developers the opportunity to use p5play commercially.

If you financially benefit from using p5play, it's only fair that you support its development!

## 3. Attribution Required

Termination can also occur for any reason, upon notice from the Licensor.

## 7. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement can be amended by the Licensor at any time. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
